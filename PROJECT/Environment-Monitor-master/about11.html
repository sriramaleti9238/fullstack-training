    <h1> About US </h1>

    <p> Our goal is to increase the awareness of pollution within the US. Project Clean Air will help visualize the pollution across the country, as well as provide support options to help minimize and decrease air pollution.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Project Clean Air is for the general public, as well as volunteer groups and agencies, but also all encompassing for anyone who's concerned with their local air quality, and the potential impacts that pollution can have on their health. Project Clean Air will help visualize and bring awareness to the issue of pollution, as well as direct people to support options. Knowledge is power, and with more awareness of this critical issue it will help spread motivation to address the issue. The major features would include a region search to see specific areas of the US and the amount of pollution in those areas, as well as a local search to see the pollution levels of the customer's area. Additionally the product will allow the customer to see the change in pollution over time in those areas, and how they can contribute to helping solve the problem.</p>
