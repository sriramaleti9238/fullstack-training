-- >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> VIEWS <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
-- VIEW is a database object that can be created like a table. 
-- In SQL a VIEW is similar to a virtual table. 
-- But unlike tables VIEWS donâ€™t actually store data. 
-- VIEWS are complex SELECT statements used as virtual tables for ease of reference and reuse. 
-- The VIEWS are useful for storing complex SQL statements as a virtual table and request the VIEW as 
-- a single table instead of a complex query.
-- Simple VIEWS may allow INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE where as complex views may not allow these operations.
